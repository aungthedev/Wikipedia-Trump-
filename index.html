        <b>Donald John Trump</b> (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician,
        media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of
        the United States from 2017 to 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trump received a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the
        <a href="#">University of Pennsylvania</a> in 1968. His father made him
        president of the family real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it
        the Trump Organization and reoriented the company toward building and
        renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a
        series of business failures in the late 1990s, he launched side
        ventures, mostly licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he
        co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He
        and his businesses have been plaintiffs or defendants in more than 4,000
        legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.
